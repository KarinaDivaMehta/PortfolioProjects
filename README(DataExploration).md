The Covid Data Exploration Project allowed me to put my skills of SQL to test and use them to analyse the available date
This ReadMe file is an insight on some of the data explored in the file

1. First I looked at the Covid Death Percentage of the population 

Comparing the United States and India's Death percentage:
United states Highest death percentage waas 10.1% with total Cases at 55 and Total Deaths at 6
Whereas, India's Highest Death Percentage was 3.5% with Total Cases at 9205 and Total Deaths at 331
To get a proper comparison, we looked at the Death Percentage of United States when the total cases were closer to India's
i.e Death Percentage of US was 2.1% when Total Cases were 9169 and Total Deaths were 194

Thus, US had a lower Death Percentage than India excluding other Factors

Taking Population into Consideration as a factor
India and Africa are an appropriate comparison considering their population is similar with 
India having population of 1407563842 and
Africa having population of 1392394303 ( China is second closest population wise)

Africa's Highest death percentage was 5.4% with total Cases at 15256 and Total Deaths at 833
To get a proper comparison, we looked at the Death Percentage of Africa when the total cases were closer to India's
i.e Death Percentage of Africa was 4.7% when Total Cases were  9264 and Total Deaths were 442

Thus,Africa had a higher death percentage than India

2.Looking at the Percentage of Population that got infected by covid by comparing Total Cases to Population

In india infection rate was under 1% until 2021 April increased to 3% in 2022 feb
Infection rate is the percentage of population that was infected by covid

3.Looking at the Highest Infection Rate, i.e the maximum percentage of population infected dby covid in a country

HighestInfectionRate as per the data is 65.5% i.e of Faeroe Islands
However, the poplation of the islands is only 52,888 which explain the higher percentage

Looking at countries with larger population
there is Portugal at 52.1% of Infection Rate ranking at number 10 of the highest percentage 
France at 50.7% of Infection Rate ranking at number 12
Israel 49.6% of Infection Rate ranking at number 13
Netherlands 47.4% of Infection Rate ranking at number 17
Belgium 38.2% of Infection Rate ranking at number 35
US: 27.4% at of Infection Rate ranking at number 56

If we consider locations with population higher than 1,000,000,000

then India has infection rate of 3.14%  
Africa has infection rate of 0.88%
China has infection rate of 0.06%
